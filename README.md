# Video Magnification

The group of Rubinstein @MIT developed and shared this amazing tools and demos where they manage to amplify the color changes or the changes in movements within a video where the subject seems to stand still.

The [TED talk you should defintely look at :)](https://www.ted.com/talks/michael_rubinstein_see_invisible_motion_hear_silent_sounds_cool_creepy_we_can_t_decide#t-778283)

More videos shared on [Michael Rubinstein's Youtube account](https://www.youtube.com/user/mikirubinstein/videos)

The few demos show:

* a man face changing color from white to red allowing to measure his heart beat
* a sleeping baby whose body deform while breathing normally
* the amazing sound reconstruction of a conversation held far away, behing a glass, by processing the video of a potato chips bag vibrating due to the human voices!!!!
